for simple startup I will make a package that can run with wgdev

this will provide me with most of the operations i need

basically I will store a last runtime and do a search for
items that have changed since then.

the search will hit both the database and filesystem

items in the filesystem will be loaded
items inthe database will be stored

it is up to the user to do updates for now.  

perhaps in the future a few git commands can run when items in the filesystem
are changed.

perhaps...
